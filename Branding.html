        <p> Success lies in a strong branding strategy and values. Nintendo doesn’t define its clientele based on age, culture or class and provides affordable and user friendly devices that target the non-gamers community as well. It also has a very wide distribution network, including retailers and its own online shops, broadening its client base in that way. By being committed to its values, resources and capabilities to recover from any setback, Nintendo has remained true to its core business and has kept its games exclusive to its own controls.</p>

        <p>At the same time, Nintendo has differentiated itself by expanding the “exergaming” experience (a hybrid between exercise and gaming) through the famous WII console and by lowering the cost of other gaming consoles, compared to its rivals. More of the brand’s strengths that help maintain its success include a long-term outlook for its products, giving importance to their research, focusing on stakeholder relationship management and having a strong presence in both traditional and new media.</p>

        <p>All in all, Nintendo is a company that ticks all the boxes of successful branding. It is a committed and sustainable brand too that strives to make its products, operations and corporate offices as environmentally friendly as possible. But most importantly is one of the most suitable examples of an adaptive business to the ever-changing circumstances, just like we, in apt, aspire to be.</p>
