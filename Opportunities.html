                <h3><b>Switch Needs Strong Third-Party Support</b></h3>
                <p>
                    To ensure the Switch's longevity and success, Nintendo needs good third-party developer support. Yes, we've all seen the fancy graphic featuring dozens of developers on board with the Switch. Sadly, this means very little, as Wii U boasted similar partnerships prior to the system's launch. Third-party Wii U support dwindled a few months after the system was released, and companies like EA abandoned Wii U software development entirely.

                    One glaring issue is the bizarre monthly game download, which lets subscribers download one NES or SNES classic title for free, for a month. The caveat, however, is that you don't get to keep it after that month is over. This is only worsened by the fact that these games are several generations old and easily obtained online via emulators. Sony and Microsoft both give you a selection of games to download and keep so long as you keep your subscription active. Sure, these monthly offerings aren't technically free either, but it's a nice perk, especially since you're paying for online connectivity anyway.

                  1-2-Switch is a party game that utilizes the Switch's portability, as well as the two Joy-Con controllers for competitive dueling and party-style challenges. This makes 1-2-Switch the ideal candidate for a bundled game, but Nintendo has opted to sell the game separately and for $50, no less. The tremendous success of Wii Sports, even in regions where the game was not bundled with the system, is very likely coloring Nintendo's decision to sell 1-2-Switch independently. Nonetheless, the game's quirky humor, silly mini games, and Switch-exclusive tech would be better suited as a bundled title rather than a standalone game.
